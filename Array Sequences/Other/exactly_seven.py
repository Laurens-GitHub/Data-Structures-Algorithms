"""
We have a catalog of song titles (and their lengths) that we play at a local radio station.  We have been asked to play two of those songs in a row, and they must add up to exactly seven minutes long.


Given a list of songs and their durations, write a function that returns the names of any two distinct songs that add up to exactly seven minutes.  If there is no such pair, return an empty collection.


Example:
song_times_1 = [
    ("Stairway to Heaven", "8:05"), ("Immigrant Song", "2:27"),
    ("Rock and Roll", "3:41"), ("Communication Breakdown", "2:29"),
    ("Good Times Bad Times", "2:48"), ("Hot Dog", "3:19"),
    ("The Crunge", "3:18"), ("Achilles Last Stand", "10:26"),
    ("Black Dog", "4:55")
]
find_pair(song_times_1) => ["Rock and Roll", "Hot Dog"] (3:41 + 3:19 = 7:00)


Additional Input:
song_times_2 = [
    ("Stairway to Heaven", "8:05"), ("Immigrant Song", "2:27"),
    ("Rock and Roll", "3:41"), ("Communication Breakdown", "2:29"),
    ("Good Times Bad Times", "2:48"), ("Black Dog", "4:55"),
    ("The Crunge", "3:18"), ("Achilles Last Stand", "10:26"),
    ("The Ocean", "4:31"), ("Hot Dog", "3:19"),
]
song_times_3 = [
    ("Stairway to Heaven", "8:05"), ("Immigrant Song", "2:27"),
    ("Rock and Roll", "3:41"), ("Communication Breakdown", "2:29"),
    ("Hey Hey What Can I Do", "4:00"), ("Poor Tom", "3:00"),
    ("Black Dog", "4:55")
]
song_times_4 = [
    ("Hey Hey What Can I Do", "4:00"), ("Rock and Roll", "3:41"),
    ("Communication Breakdown", "2:29"), ("Going to California", "3:30"),
    ("Black Mountain Side", "2:00"), ("Black Dog", "4:55")
]
song_times_5 = [("Celebration Day", "3:30"), ("Going to California", "3:30")]
